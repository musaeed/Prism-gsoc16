# Major features added in Prism

- Support for error bars
- Support for deviation plots
- Support for Histograms
- Designed a dialog box for selecting histogram properties
- Dynamic updating of the graphs while a longer experiment runs
- Support for parametric operations from the GUI
- Support for parametric graphs with options to change the sampling of the function dynamically
- Support for exporting the plots in a gnuplot readable format including the histograms
- Support for exporting the plots from the command line using the -exportplot switch
- Added additional options to modify the properties of various plots that can be exported from the command line and support for auto format detection
- fixed the progress for the simulation experiments
- Added support for mixed plots (xy graphs and parametric graphs) to be plotted on the same plot
- Added support for 3d charts using the orson chart library (parametric for now)
- 3d plot exports to many formats including jpeg, png, pdf and gnuplot
