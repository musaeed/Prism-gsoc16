# This week's goals
* Getting more familiar with the Prism code base
* Support of Error bars will be added in Prism. This will be plotted as an additional information when a result is not just an exact value but an approximated one. The error plots will tell the user the amount of error this approximated result could have.
* Support for deviation plots will be added
