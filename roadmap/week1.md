# This week's goals
* Getting more familiar with the Prism code base
* Support of Error bars will be added in Prism. This will be plotted as an additional information when a result is not just an exact value but an approximated one. The error plots will tell the user the amount of error this approximated result could have.
* Support for Histograms will be added in Prism. This will give the user an opportunity to look at the probabilities of all the states that are currently analysed by the Prism tool
